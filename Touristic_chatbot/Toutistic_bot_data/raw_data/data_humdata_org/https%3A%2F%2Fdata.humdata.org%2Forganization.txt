Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) has a central mission: to carry out research and advocacy in order to reduce the incidence and impact of global armed violence. The need to do so is clearly a great one. The number of fatalities from armed violence is estimated to be over half a million people killed every year. And around two thirds of these violent deaths are estimated to occur outside conflict situations. To help reduce this burden of pain and suffering, we at AOAV carry out research and advocacy campaigns to strengthen international laws and standards on the availability and use of conventional and improvised weapons, to build recognition of the rights of victims and survivors of armed violence, and to research, understand and act effectively on the root causes of armed violence in affected countries. Research One of the central pillars of our work is our Global Explosive Violence Monitor, as well as the specific research we carry out on manufactured weapons, Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and guns. Advocacy AOAV tries to lobby governments and non-state actors through rigorous research and data, to curb the excessive use of force. In so doing, we regularly present our evidence at the United Nations, as well as the UK Parliament, Chatham House and other influential fora.

When a user downloads ACLED’s disaggregated event-based data, each row in the file represents a single event occurring between designated actors in a specific named location on a specific day. In the spatially and temporarily aggregated files available on HDX, each row in the data represents a country-year (e.g. Iraq-2017) or a country-month-year (e.g. Somalia-January 2010), depending on the file.

The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) is the world’s foremost agency for the study of public health during mass emergencies, including the epidemiology of diseases, plus the structural and socio-economic impacts of natural and technological disasters and human conflicts.
Based since 1973 at the School of Public Health of the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Belgium, CRED became in 1980 a World Health Organization (WHO) collaboration centre. Since then, CRED has worked closely with United Nations agencies, inter-governmental and governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes and other universities.
Disasters preparedness, mitigation and prevention for vulnerable populations have also gained a higher profile within CRED’s activities in recent years. CRED is maintaining the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) since 1988. The main objectives of EM-DAT are to inform humanitarian action at the national and international levels in order to improve rational decision-making in disaster preparedness, provide objective data for assessing communities’ vulnerability to disasters and help policy-makers set priorities.
EM-DAT contains core data on the occurrence and effects of more than 23,000 natural and technological disasters from 1900 to the present day. It is compiled from various sources (UN agencies, the US Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, national governments, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, NGOs, insurance companies, research institutes and the media) according to a priority list. CRED defines a disaster as “a situation or event that overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request at the national or international level for external assistance; an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction and human suffering”.
CRED defines a disaster as “a situation or event that overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request at the national or international level for external assistance; an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction and human suffering”. Only natural disasters (biological excluded) are included in this publication. For a disaster to be entered into the database, at least one of the following criteria must be fulfilled: • 10 or more people reported killed • 100 or more people reported affected • declaration of a state of emergency • call for international assistance Since 2014, EM-DAT also georeferences natural disasters, adding geographical values to numeric data which is essential for deeper analysis.
