Conflict and disaster population movement (flows) data for State of Palestine.
The IDU (Internal Displacement Updates) dataset, provided by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), offers timely event data and provisional information on new internal displacements caused by conflicts and disasters. Representing the most recent available information over a 180-day time period, the IDU is updated daily and focuses on "flows" (new displacements).
Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are defined according to the 1998 Guiding Principles as people or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of armed conflict, or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an international border. The IDMC's event data, sourced from the IDU, provides initial assessments of these internal displacements, reflecting continually updated provisional information from various sources.
While the IDU offers early insights, the more thoroughly validated and curated "stock"  (Total number of people leaving on internal displacement) and "flow" (population movements) estimates are available in the annual Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD). Both datasets are accessible via API, with specific guidance on data access, structure, and limitations, including important preprocessing considerations for the IDU to ensure accurate analysis and avoid double-counting. For further detailed information and complete API specifications, users are encouraged to consult the official documentation at
https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/api-documentation/

The IDMC's Event data, sourced from the Internal Displacement Updates (IDU), offers initial assessments of internal displacements reported within the last 180 days. This dataset provides provisional information that is continually updated on a daily basis, reflecting the availability of data on new displacements arising from conflicts and disasters. The finalized, carefully curated, and validated estimates are then made accessible through the Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD). The IDU dataset comprises preliminary estimates aggregated from various publishers or sources.

IDMC - Internally displaced persons
The Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD), maintained by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), provides comprehensive, validated annual estimates of internal displacement worldwide. It defines internally displaced persons (IDPs) in line with the 1998 Guiding Principles, as people or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of armed conflict, or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an international border.
The GIDD tracks two primary metrics: "People Displaced" or population "Stock" figures, which represent the total number of people living in displacement at year-end, and "New Displacement," which counts new displacement incidents (population Flows) rather than individual people, accounting for potential multiple displacements by the same person. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for understanding long-term trends and validated displacement figures globally. For further detailed information and complete API specifications, users are encouraged to consult the official documentation at
https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/api-documentation/
.
"Internally displaced persons - IDPs" refers to the number of people living in displacement as of the end of each year.
"Internal displacements (New Displacements)" refers to the number of new cases or incidents of displacement recorded, rather than the number of people displaced. This is done because people may have been displaced more than once.

The resources subnational multidimensional poverty data from the data tables published by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford. The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) measures multidimensional poverty in over 100 developing countries, using internationally comparable datasets and is updated annually. The measure captures the severe deprivations that each person faces at the same time using information from 10 indicators, which are grouped into three equally weighted dimensions: health, education, and living standards. The global MPI methodology is detailed in Alkire, Kanagaratnam & Suppa (2023)

UNOSAT code: CE20231007PSE  This map a satellite imagery-based comprehensive assessment of damage and destruction to greenhouses within the area of interest in the Gaza Strip, Occupied Palestinian Territory, based on images collected on 3 and 23 December 2024 when compared to images collected on 18 August 2024, 23-24 April 2024, 30-31 March 2024, 23 March 2024, 21 March 2024, 26 November 2023, 7 November 2023, 24-26 October 2023, 21 October 20223, 15 October  1 May 2023, 10 May 2023, 18 September 2023, 15 October 2023, 10 October 2023, 18 September 2023, 10 May 2023, and 1 May 2023. According to satellite imagery analysis, UNOSAT identified 4,578 destroyed greenhouses, 439 severely damaged greenhouses, and 643 moderately damaged greenhouses for a total of 5660 greenhouses. This accounts for approximately 64% of the total greenhouses in the Gaza Strip, with 33% of these suffering additional damage since the previous assessment on 18 August 2024. Furthermore, 6% of the damage recorded in December 2024 is new compared to the previous analysis. In terms of surface area, 56% of the greenhouse extent is now damaged, reflecting a 37% increase compared to the previous analysis.
The governorate of Rafah has experienced the highest increase in new damage since the 18 August 2024 analysis, with around 838 new greenhouses affected. Khan Yunis has seen an intensification of previously damaged greenhouses, with 703 more greenhouses sustaining further damage. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.

UNOSAT code: CE20231007PSE  This map illustrates satellite-detected changes in cropland areas of the Gaza Strip resulting from the decline in the health and density of crops due to the ongoing conflict. UNOSAT conducted an analysis utilising satellite imagery collected by the Sentinel-2 satellite between December 2017 and 2024, performing a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis as well as a multitemporal classification to identify notable changes taking place in cropland areas during that timeframe. The methodology evaluated the damage as a decline in the health and density of crops in December 2024, compared to the preceding seven seasons spanning from 2017 to 2024. The decline in the health and density of the crops can be observed due to the impact of activities such as razing, heavy vehicle activity, bombing, shelling, and other conflict-related dynamics. The analysis includes damage assessment for orchards and other trees, field crops and vegetables. UNOSAT and FAO analysis shows that the cropland extent in the Gaza Strip is estimated to be 150 sq. km, accounting for approximately 41% of the total area of the Gaza Strip, following an extensive land-cover analysis.
Compared to the average of the previous seven years, approximately 75% of the permanent crop fields in the Gaza Strip exhibited a significant decline in health and density in September 2024. In a comprehensive evaluation, it was found that there has been a 10% increase in the proportion of cropland that has been damaged since the previous analysis conducted in September 2024. Additionally, the analysis indicates a notable rise in the destruction of the orchards and other trees, field crops and vegetables in the Deir al-Balah Governorate, with a 9-percentage point increase compared to the previous July 2024 analysis. Moreover, there has been a notable escalation in the destruction of cropland within the Rafah Governorate, with the percentage rising from 57% in September 2024 to 67% in December 2024. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field.
