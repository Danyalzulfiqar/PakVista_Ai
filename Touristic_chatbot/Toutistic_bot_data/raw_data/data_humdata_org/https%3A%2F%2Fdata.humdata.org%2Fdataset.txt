Earthquake, tsunami and tropical cyclones calculations and assessments are done automatically, without human intervention. Floods and volcanic eruptions are currently manually introduced. Research and development is continuous to improve the global monitoring.

In response to the Somaliaâ€™s severe drought beginning in November 2021, DTM Somalia launched an Emergency Trends Tracking (ETT) tool first in Gedo and Bay regions in 2022, and subsequently in Hiraan, Banadir and Middle Shabelle regions in 2023 to monitor drought related displacement trends and hotspots in support of operational planning. However, during the first half of 2023, conflict and flooding displacements have been significant. Therefore, DTM restructured its ETT tool to capture multi-shock displacements (drought, flood, conflict and other) from October 2023. In April 2024, ETT was conducted to monitor displacements movements during the Gu rainy season. This latest round of ETT was initiated in February 2025 to monitor displacement movements during the Jilaal dry season. ETT is a crisis-based tool that tracks sudden displacement triggered by specific events or emerging crises. The objective of ETT is to help prioritize humanitarian response and to enable partners to deliver rapid assistance.

WFP - Rainfall Indicators at Subnational Level
This dataset contains dekadal rainfall indicators, computed from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation satellite imagery with insitu Station data (CHIRPS) version 2 and the CHIRPS-GEFS short term rainfall forecasts, aggregated by subnational administrative units.
Included indicators are (for each dekad):
10 day rainfall [mm] (rfh)
rainfall 1-month rolling aggregation [mm] (r1h)
rainfall 3-month rolling aggregation [mm] (r3h)
rainfall long term average [mm] (rfh_avg)
rainfall 1-month rolling aggregation long term average [mm] (r1h_avg)
rainfall 3-month rolling aggregation long term average [mm] (r3h_avg)
rainfall anomaly [%] (rfq)
rainfall 1-month anomaly [%] (r1q)
rainfall 3-month anomaly [%] (r3q)
The administrative units used for aggregation are based on WFP data and contain a Pcode reference attributed to each unit. The number of input pixels used to create the aggregates, is provided in the n_pixels column. Finally, the type column indicates if the value is based on a forecast, a preliminary or a final product.
Forecasts are issued on the 6th, 16th, and 26th of each month for the upcoming 10-day period (dekad), then updated with improved versions on the 1st, 11th, and 21st.
Preliminary observations replace the previous dekadâ€™s forecast on the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd, and are later replaced by final observationsâ€”published mid-month (13th or 23rd)â€”covering all three dekads of the prior month. Please find a summary below:
Publication Day: Forecast type, Covers (Dekad)
1st: Updated forecast, 1â€“10 of the same month
6th: Initial forecast, 11â€“20 of the same month
11th: Updated forecast, 1â€“10 of the same month
16th: Initial forecast, 21â€“end of the same month
21st: Updated forecast, 11â€“20 of the same month
26th: Initial forecast, 1â€“10 of the following month

HungerMapLIVE is the World Food Programme (WFP)â€™s global hunger monitoring system. It combines key metrics from various data sources â€“ such as food security information, weather, population size, conflict, hazards, nutrition information and macro-economic data â€“ to help assess, monitor and predict the magnitude and severity of hunger in near real-time. The resulting analysis is displayed on an interactive map that helps WFP staff, key decision makers and the broader humanitarian community to make more informed and timely decisions relating to food security.
The platform covers 94 countries, including countries where WFP has operations as well as most lower and lower-middle income countries (as classified by the World Bank).

IDMC - Internal Displacement Updates
Conflict and disaster population movement (flows) data for South Africa.
The IDU (Internal Displacement Updates) dataset, provided by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), offers timely event data and provisional information on new internal displacements caused by conflicts and disasters. Representing the most recent available information over a 180-day time period, the IDU is updated daily and focuses on "flows" (new displacements).
Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are defined according to the 1998 Guiding Principles as people or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of armed conflict, or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an international border. The IDMC's event data, sourced from the IDU, provides initial assessments of these internal displacements, reflecting continually updated provisional information from various sources.
While the IDU offers early insights, the more thoroughly validated and curated "stock"  (Total number of people leaving on internal displacement) and "flow" (population movements) estimates are available in the annual Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD). Both datasets are accessible via API, with specific guidance on data access, structure, and limitations, including important preprocessing considerations for the IDU to ensure accurate analysis and avoid double-counting. For further detailed information and complete API specifications, users are encouraged to consult the official documentation at
https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/api-documentation/

The IDMC's Event data, sourced from the Internal Displacement Updates (IDU), offers initial assessments of internal displacements reported within the last 180 days.

The finalized, carefully curated, and validated estimates are then made accessible through the Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD). The IDU dataset comprises preliminary estimates aggregated from various publishers or sources.

IDMC - Internally displaced persons
The Global Internal Displacement Database (GIDD), maintained by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), provides comprehensive, validated annual estimates of internal displacement worldwide. It defines internally displaced persons (IDPs) in line with the 1998 Guiding Principles, as people or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of armed conflict, or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights, or natural or human-made disasters and who have not crossed an international border.
The GIDD tracks two primary metrics: "People Displaced" or population "Stock" figures, which represent the total number of people living in displacement at year-end, and "New Displacement," which counts new displacement incidents (population Flows) rather than individual people, accounting for potential multiple displacements by the same person. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for understanding long-term trends and validated displacement figures globally. For further detailed information and complete API specifications, users are encouraged to consult the official documentation at
https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/api-documentation/
.
"Internally displaced persons - IDPs" refers to the number of people living in displacement as of the end of each year.
"Internal displacements (New Displacements)" refers to the number of new cases or incidents of displacement recorded, rather than the number of people displaced. This is done because people may have been displaced more than once.
