COD - Subnational Population Statistics
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) partnered with donors and UN agencies and took up the lead role to support the Somali authorities in undertaking the Population Estimation Survey (PESS) for Somalia in October 2013- March 2014.
UNFPA investigated replacement or projection of this dataset in 2021.  Only ADM0 (national) data was available.  No better alternative is currently available.
PESS gathered basic critical information on the Somalis living in urban, rural and nomadic areas (interviewed at water points during the peak of the long, dry season), and in settlements for internally displaced persons. One standard questionnaire was used in selected enumeration areas or pre-identified areas. Data was collected in three main phases: cartographic field mapping, household listing in the sampled areas, and the interviewing of households using the standard questionnaire.
PESS report by UNFPA had only the population estimate at regional level (Admin level 1). With the demand to get this data disaggregated to district level to enhance assessment and in particular assessments of people in food insecure by FAO-FSNAU, the district data was interpolated using FSNAU livelihood information embedded in the 2005 UNDP district level population data
The data collected in 2024 has now been endorsed for use.

COD - Subnational Population Statistics
Subnational Population Statistics are produced by and contributed to HDX by UNFPA and, in the case of Ukraine, are exceptionally shared by OCHA Ukraine with the approval of UNFPA.
The 2024 Common Operational Dataset on Population Statistics (COD-PS) update for Ukraine presents raion-level (ADM-2), oblast-level (ADM-1) and national-level (ADM-0) estimates of population size by sex and standard 5-year demographic age groups. The 2024 COD-PS update revises the 2023 COD-PS update and 2022 COD-PS update produced by UNFPA, by accounting for recent population change due to mobility, mortality and fertility dynamics.
This COD-PS update was prepared by the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA. This update was prepared in consultation with the Humanitarian Country Team and UN Country Team in Ukraine, as well as national partners including the Institute for Demography and Quality of Life Problems, Ukraine and the State Statistics Service of Ukraine.
The 2024 COD-PS update, like all COD-PS updates, is strictly a humanitarian data product of the United Nations aligned to the "best available humanitarian data standard". It does not represent or, in any way, replace official statistics or official population projections of the Government of Ukraine and it is not intended to meet the international standards of official statistics.
The Ukraine Common Operational Dataset on Population Statistics (COD-PS) 2024 is a restricted dataset, in line with applicable national laws and the host country agreement with the United Nations. It is shared only with the Ukraine Humanitarian Country Team, UN Country Team in Ukraine, and the Government of Ukraine.

COD - Subnational Administrative Boundaries
Chad administrative level 0-2 boundaries (COD-AB) dataset.

Note: The February 2025 update reassigned ADM2 feature ""Abdi"" now [TCD2102] from ""Ouaddai"" province to ""Sila"" province, and  ""Djourouf al Ahmarwas"" now [now TCD1402] reassigned in the opposite direction.  NOTE also that the Chad P-code prefix will be updated from ""TD"" to ""TCD"" in accordance with the local Information Management Working Group preference.
Apparently substantial Administrative level 2 boundary alterations:
""Dagana' [TCD0501] in ADM1 feature ""Hadjer Lamis' and ""Wayi' [TCD0702] in ADM1 feature ""Lac"".
""Bahr Koh"" [TCD1301] in ADM1 feature ""Moyen Chari"" and ""Loug Chari"" in ADM1 feature ""Chari Baguirmi"".

COD - Subnational Administrative Boundaries
The actual boundaries were most recently adjusted in:  January 2025.
Boundary information source:  State Scientific Production Enterprise “Kartographia”.
Contributor:  OCHA Field Information Services Section (FISS).
COD-AB quality level:  cod-enhanced (geometry and attributes verified and standardized).
Most recent COD-AB review conclusion:  The COD-AB does not require any update.
An edge-matched (COD-EM) dataset is available
COD-EM HDX link:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-em-ukr
.
OCHA country status:  Operational (country office).
Most recent COD-AB review date:  January 2025.
Deepest administrative level:  ADM4.
COD-PS HDX URL:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-ukr
.
Deepest administrative level with complete coverage:  ADM3.
Administrative level required by humanitarian community:  ADM2.
Note:  The Ukrainian government has not fully implemented its new administrative structure reforms in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [UA01] and Sevastopol [UA85].
Consequently, 31 ADM4 features within the Sevastopol ADM3 polygon retain P-codes that do not correctly conform to [UA85]. This will be rectified in a COD-AB update once the government has regained control of the Crimean Peninsula.
Note:  Some administrative feature names were adjusted in a September/October 2024 administratrive feature renaming exercise.  See reference table at
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-ukr
.
Note:  The Ukraine COD-AB was most recently adjusted in early 2024 - affecting administrative level 3 (hromadas) only.
Note:  The population statistics common operational dataset (COD-PS-UKR) is only available via special request.  See Ukraine - Subnational Population Statistics.  Users should use the 'Request Data' button.
Note:  Limitations of the Ukrainian-to-Russian transliteration method mean that more than one Ukrainian name may be represented by a single Russian feature name.
Note:  Feature name attribute fields in this dataset incorrectly use 'UA' to represent the Ukrainian language.  The correct language code is 'UK'.  This will be resolved in 2026.
Note:  ADM0 is not affected by the September/October 2024 administrative feature renaming exercise.
Typical feature type:  oblast (region) with three exceptions.
P-code format:  UAnn.
COD-PS compatibility:  ADM0, ADM1, ADM2.
OCHA region:  Europe.
Feature count:  27.
The ADM1 layer can be linked by P-CODE to the ADM1 Population statistics.
Note:  Kyiv (city) [UA80] and Sevastopol [UA85] are each a 'city with special status' rather than an 'oblast'.
Note:  Crimea [UA01] is an 'autonomous republic' rather than an 'oblast'.
Note:  However, Ukraine Population Statistics are only available on special request.
ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL 4 metadata:
Typical feature type:  ADM4 features may be of 'city', 'settlement', or 'village' type.  However, all 'village' features are currently categorized in the 'ADM4_TYPE' as a 'settlement'.  This is expected to be resolved in 2026.
P-code format:  UAnnnnnnnnnn.
Feature count:  29707.
COD-PS compatibility:  no ADM4 population statistics are available.
COD-PS HDX URL:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ps-ukr
.
Note:  329 ADM4 features were affected by the September/October 2024 administrative feature renaming excercise.
Specific details are provided in the 'ADM4' tab of the 'UKR_Admin234_Renaming_ReferenceTable_20250123.xlsx' reference table available on the HDX dataset Ukraine - Subnational Administrative Boundaries.
Note:  The COD-AB ADM4 boundary attributes for this COD-AB have not been adjusted.
The Ukrainian government has not fully implemented its new administrative structure reforms in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea [UA01] and Sevastopol [UA85].
Consequently, 31 ADM4 features within the Sevastopol ADM3 polygon retain P-codes that do not correctly conform to [UA85].  This will be rectified in a COD-AB update once the government has regained control of the Crimean Peninsula.

COD - Subnational Administrative Boundaries
Somalia administrative level 0-2 boundaries (COD-AB) dataset.Boundaries established:    1984
NOTE:  In addition to administrative levels 0-2, this dataset includes ""level 1 Operational Zones"" (OPZ1) and ""level 2 Operational Zones"" (OPZ2).  17 OPZ1 features within the Banadir administrative level 1 feature are now (as of the January 2025 update) coincident with individual administrative level 2 features.  Two further OPZ1 features within the Banadir administrative level 1 polygon are excluded from the administrative structure and must be named and P-coded as 'unspecified'.  All Operational Zones are not administrative boundaries and are not identified as administrative level 3 features.  The six Federal member states (Somaliland, Puntland, Galmudug, Hirshabelle, South West, and Jubaland) are NOT integrated into the administrative structure.  (Their boundaries cannot be constructed even from administrative level 2 features.)
This COD-AB was most recently reviewed for accuracy and necessary changes in December 2024.  The COD-AB does not require any update.
