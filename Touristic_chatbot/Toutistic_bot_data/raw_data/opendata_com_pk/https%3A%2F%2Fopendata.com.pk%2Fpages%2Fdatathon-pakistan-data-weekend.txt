Datathon is powered by Open Data Pakistan and National Center in Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC) at LUMS together with Ignite under MoITT and National Incubation Center Lahore.
Pakistan Data Weekend competition aims to bring together coders, data enthusiasts, civic-minded designers, analysts, mappers and project managers to hunt, ideate, crunch and visualize - open and reusable, social, economic and environmental - data available through Open Data Pakistan.
