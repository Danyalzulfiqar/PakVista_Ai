Media Ownership Monitor Pakistan 2018.pdf
How can people evaluate the reliability of information if they don't know who provides it? How can journalists
work properly if they don't know who controls the company they work for? And how can media authorities
address excessive media concentration if they don't know who is behind the media's steering wheel?
Ownership structure may also affect the way the media industry manages its resources. It shapes the economic
strength and efficiency of the media sector, which is of particular interest to potential investors.
The Media Ownership Monitor found that a high degree of concentration in ownership and audience
share prevails in the media industry in Pakistan and a professionally weak regulatory system poses a
threat to media pluralism and freedom of expression in the country.
