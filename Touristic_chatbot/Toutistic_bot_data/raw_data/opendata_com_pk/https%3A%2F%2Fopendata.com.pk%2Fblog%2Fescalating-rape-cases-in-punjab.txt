Escalating Rape Cases in Punjab: Action Needed Now
June 14, 2024
Since 2009, Punjab has experienced a rise in the number of reported rape incidents. Bear in mind that these numbers may not accurately reflect the actual number of victims because many rape victims choose not to report rape due to a variety of reasons, such as social stigma, victim-blaming, a misogynistic culture (which places victims at the forefront of judgment and slut-shaming), threats from rapists, a weak judicial system (where rapists roam freely even after committing such a heinous crime and are not convicted), and a host of other factors.

While other criminal activities in Punjab have fluctuated over time (figure 2), reported rapes have mostly increased (figure 1), with only a couple of exceptions in specific years. Even in the years after high-profile rape incidents made headlines, like the motorway incident in 2020 and the Zainab Ansari case in 2018, we haven't observed a decline in the number of rape incidents. This could be partially because, in the majority of rape cases against women, most of our people end up blaming the victim. While there are protests, people are more concerned about the questions of “Why and what time did she go out?” and "What was she wearing?” than anything else. The proper question, which most people neglect to pose, is, “What makes a rapist commit such a heinous act? And what can we at the grassroots level do to ensure nobody ever dares to commit such a crime?”
These figures, despite their underrepresentation, serve as reminders that our society and culture incite an environment in which rapists can act without fear of repercussions. Therefore, the government and legislators must take steps to ensure a safe environment for its citizens.
